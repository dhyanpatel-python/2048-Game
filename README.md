Introduction

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players can only move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The challenge comes from the fact that with each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 randomly appears on the board. The game is won when a 2048 tile is created, and the game is lost when the grid is full, and no more valid moves can be made.

  3.  Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (up, down, left, right) or the on-screen arrow buttons to move the tiles in the respective direction.
  4.  When two tiles with the same number collide as a result of the move, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
  5.  After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid.
  6.  Continue merging tiles and strategizing your moves to reach the elusive 2048 tile!
